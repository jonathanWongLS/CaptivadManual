#Users
[[PRODUCTNAME]] has a full featured User module that allows individual access to the CMS by multiple people with user name and password authentication.

Users are granted access to the web portal through their User Type and Permission settings that have been pre-configured by an administrator.

##Groups
Users belong to a User Group and inherit the permissions granted to that group.

##Ownership
All items created in the CMS by a user are owned by the user. Having ownership of an item (be it a layout, media, or scheduled event) gives that user full permissions over the item and the ability to share that item with other users.

##API
Users may also grant API applications access to the CMS using their credentials.
