#Font
[[PRODUCTNAME]] comes with a set of standard fonts provided by our text editor tool - CKEditor.

The font module allows extra fonts to be added to the CMS and display clients.

The font module is a library based module and requires fonts to be added from the library page.

##Adding a new font
Adding and Installing a font is a two step process - firstly the font must be uploaded using the Add Form.
