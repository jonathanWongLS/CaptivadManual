## Engine Out

So, you want to get "under the hood" and see how the software works and how it
can be extended? [[PRODUCTNAME]] is a complicated system and before approaching
any development work it is important to understand what you are trying to
achieve and the best tools in the platform to help you do so.

The following are typical requirements:

 - Integrate with a 3rd party application [[CMS API](cms_api.html)]
 - Customise the visual presentation of the CMS [[Themes](advanced_theme.html)]
 - Create a new Module [[Modules](advanced_modules.html)]
 - Extend the CMS with new functionality [[Extending](advanced_extending.html)]
 - Extend the Player with new functionality or make a bespoke Player [[Player API](xmds.html)]

Each of the above contains a link to the necessary documentation which will
help you with your requirement.
