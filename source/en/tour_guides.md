[[PRODUCTNAME]] has a large back catalogue of guides, videos and FAQ's for you to refer to - far too many to include directly in this manual. Instead we have made these available online in our community, blog and YouTube.

The essential getting started guide is in this manual and covers all the basics needed to set up a cafe menu sign. This can be found here: [Getting Started with [[PRODUCTNAME]]. A simple Cafe worked example](guide_getting_started_cafe_menu.html)
