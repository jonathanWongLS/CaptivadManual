#Welcome to the Tour!

[[PRODUCTNAME]] is a flexible and powerful application with a core "ethos" to digital signage that is important to understand from the very beginning.

The software centres itself on 5 core concepts:

*   Displays
*   Media
*   Layouts
*   Scheduling
*   Users

We can sum up what [[PRODUCTNAME]] does with a simple sentence using these 5 concepts! [[PRODUCTNAME]] enables a User to upload Media and arrange it in a Layout which they can Schedule on one or more connected Displays.

It sounds simple enough?! Of course there are many more features to take advantage of and this manual has sections for all of these things, but lets take a quick look at the main 5 to get started.


###Displays
These represent the hardware connected to the TV/Projector/Tablet panel that is actually displaying the end content. In other words Displays drive the medium people will look at. Each Display is uniquely identified in the CMS so that they can have their own unique content, layout designs and schedules set to them. They can also be uniquely identified for reporting statistics.

###Media
Media content is the core of a [[PRODUCTNAME]] solution and many different types of content are supported. These are generally split into two categories. File based media that is uploaded and stored in the Library and Layout based media that doesn't have an associated file but is configured directly on a Layout instead. An image or video would be Library Media and a RSS feed or some free Text would be Layout based media.

###Layouts
These are the design that is seen on the screen. [[PRODUCTNAME]] allows you to split the screen up into different Regions, each containing their own Playlist. A Layout itself remains on screen until all the Regions have finished playing through once, then an entirely fresh Layout can be loaded with different positioning and size of Regions, with different Timelines. This flexibility drives the dynamic nature of an [[PRODUCTNAME]] display screen.

###Scheduling
Once displays are registered, media content is uploaded and Layouts are designed it is time to put them all together and Schedule Layouts onto Displays. Each Display will check for new Scheduled content periodically, and download Scheduled Items in advance of playback. Scheduling is highly flexible and supports scheduling to single Displays and Groups, single Layouts and Campaigns and Recurring Schedules. Each Display has a Default Layout that will be shown when nothing else is Scheduled.

### Users

Users are people that access the CMS through the web portal. They are identified by a username and password which they must enter before they are allowed access.  All actions taken in the CMS are "owned" by a User.

[[PRODUCTNAME]] supports 3 types of User, User Groups and multi-level Permissions to all parts of the CMS and all items stored in the CMS. It can also integrate with ActiveDirector/LDAP in the corporate environment.

[[PRODUCTNAME]] can play a wide range of file based content, as well as consuming content from the Internet.

*   Text

A full list of features are available on the [[PRODUCTNAME]] website.



## CMS - How can all this be managed?

Management of a solution as flexible as [[PRODUCTNAME]] required a powerful CMS (Content Management System) to present the core concepts in a sensible, controlled fashion. The [[PRODUCTNAME]] CMS is packed with features, such as:

*   User Groups
*   User and Group Permissions
*   Display Groups
*   Display Group Permissions
*   Menu and Page Permissions
*   Campaigns (ordered groups of Layouts)
*   Layout Templates
*   Display Statistics



## The Manual

This manual has been organised into sections that broadly represent the core concepts and the more advanced CMS features. We start off with the Library, Layouts and Scheduling and then move on to Display Management, Users and Developer Options.
