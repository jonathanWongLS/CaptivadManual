# Twitter Metro

The [[PRODUCTNAME]] Twitter widget provides access to the 
[Twitter Search API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search).

## Installation

Please refer to the [Twitter](media_module_twitter.html) documentation for installation instructions.
You can use the same Twitter API key/secret to configure the Twitter Metro Module.

## Adding to a Layout

The Metro Widget can be added to a Layout by selecting "Twitter Metro" from the Widget chooser on
the Edit Timeline form.

The template tab of the form allows you to specify a color pallet for the Metro tiles.

The Widget will automatically size portrait/landscape based on the size of the Region that it is
added to. It will resize as if it were an image for best consistency across all Display resolutions.

When selecting an effect, the effect will apply to each tile.
