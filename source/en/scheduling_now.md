#Schedule Now
Schedule Now functionality is available throughout the CMS and provides a quick way to Schedule a 
Campaign or Layout for a specific amount of time.

This is typically used for displaying temporary notices on the signage system.

Schedule Now functionality is available from the following pages:
- Campaign
- Layout
- Layout Designer
- Display

The form has been standardised across all areas of the CMS.

## Timezones

Events created using the Schedule Now form will always have the "Run at CMS time" option
selected. This means that the event will be adjusted for each Display timezone and forced
to run from the time "Save" is pressed.

More information about this option can be found on the [Events](scheduling_events.html#run_at_cms_time)
page.
