#Logging In
The CMS is protected by an authentication system that requires a user name and password.

During installation a user name and password is provided which grants unrestricted access to all areas of the CMS. Additional user accounts can be created with various permissions.

More information on the users, user groups and permissions can be found in the [users section](users.html) of this manual.

**All pages** in the CMS are authenticated and if the user is not logged a login form will appear.



##First time access

###Administrators

###New Users

##Cookies
The CMS uses cookies to track whether users are logged in or not. If you are experiencing trouble logging in you may need to adjust your browser settings for cookies.
