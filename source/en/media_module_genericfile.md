#Generic Files
The generic file module is used to send additional files to the display client that can then be used for other purposes.

There are two good examples of when this might be useful.

## Embedded HTML
Supplementary files can be provided to be used as relative paths in embedded HTML.

For example, an up and down arrow that is dynamically shown in the embedded HTML based on the results of some stock data.

## Auto Update
The functionality exists to act as a foundation for auto-client update.
