#Metrics
[[PRODUCTNAME]] provides several useful metrics for administrators and other users to view within the CMS.

The metrics are designed to provide a centralised area for analysis into display performance and usage.

## Bandwidth
The CMS records the bandwidth used by each display when connecting to the XMDS service for content and when reporting back display information.

The default view for the bandwidth chart is a total per Display - this can be expanded to a total per XMDS item by filtering on the Display.

## Availability
The CMS records all Display on / off line events to provide a picture of display availability.

## Proof of Play
Displays collect information on each Layout and Media item they show to provide a Proof of Play report by:

- Layout
- Media
- Media on Layout

_Statistics can be enabled / disabled for most signage players in the display settings profile._
